Author: [Linh Tran]    
Tools Used: SQL  

## Introduction
Welcome to my first project on exploring e-commerce data! This repository features the SQL script titled "Explore E-Commerce Dataset", which delves into analyzing e-commerce data using Google Analytics samples. Our goal is to derive valuable insights into customer behaviors, website performance, and transactional trends.

## File Description
The script "SQL_E-commerce Data" comprises a series of SQL queries targeted at various aspects of e-commerce data analysis:
- **Monthly Trends Analysis:** Queries to scrutinize visits, pageviews, and transactions, segmented by month.
- **Traffic Source Analysis:** In-depth examination of various traffic sources, assessing total visits, bounce rates, and their overall impact on website engagement.
- **Revenue Analysis by Time and Source:** Advanced queries to analyze product revenue based on different time frames (monthly, weekly) and traffic sources. This helps in understanding which sources and time periods are most lucrative for the e-commerce business.

## Prerequisites
- An SQL environment compatible with Google Analytics datasets, like BigQuery.
- Understanding of SQL and Google Analytics data structures.
- Access to an e-commerce dataset from Google Analytics.
