## ‚öíÔ∏è Main Process

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb AND March 2017

    >  Scrutinize visits, pageviews, and transactions, segmented by month to analysis Monthly Trends Analysis

```sql
--Query 01: calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb AND March 2017 (order by month)
SELECT
    FORMAT_DATE("%Y%m",PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d',date)) AS month,
    SUM(totals.visits) AS visits,
    SUM(totals.pageviews) AS pageviews,
    SUM(totals.transactions) AS transactions,
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
WHERE _table_suffix BETWEEN '0101' AND '0331'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

</p>



üëâ Pageviews follow a similar pattern, staying relatively stable. Transactions, however, show steady growth, peaking in March.  
‚úîÔ∏è This suggests increasing user activity and conversions, potentially influenced by marketing efforts or seasonal demand.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017

    > A bounce rate indicates that customers who visited our website left without making a purchase.

```sql
--Query 02: Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017 (Bounce_rate = num_bounce/total_visit) (order by total_visit DESC)
SELECT
    trafficSource.source,
    SUM(totals.visits) AS total_visits,
    SUM(totals.bounces) AS total_no_of_bounces,
    ROUND(SUM(totals.bounces)/SUM(totals.visits)*100, 3) AS Bounce_rate
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*` 
Where _table_suffix BETWEEN '0701' AND '0731'
GROUP BY trafficSource.source
ORDER BY total_visits DESC;
```

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a2dad05-d640-481b-b6c4-bf7332d647a3" alt="Description">
</p>

üëâ **Google** drives the highest traffic but has a moderate bounce rate (~51.56%).  
üëâ **YouTube.com** has the highest bounce rate (66.73%), suggesting visitors leave quickly after arriving.  
üëâ **Direct traffic** performs well with a lower bounce rate (43.26%), indicating more engaged users.  
üëâ **m.facebook.com** has the highest bounce rate (64.27%), meaning Facebook users might not be highly engaged.  
‚úîÔ∏è Overall, optimizing high-bounce sources like YouTube and Facebook could improve retention.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue by traffic source by week, by month in June 2017

    > Assess how effectively the website performs across different traffic sources


```sql

üëâ Non-purchasers consistently have higher average page views than purchasers, suggesting they browse more without completing a purchase.  
üëâ The average page views for both groups increased from June to July, indicating higher overall engagement.  
üëâ The increase in page views for purchasers in July might indicate a rise in customer interest or improved marketing efforts.  
üëâ A higher average pageview for non-purchasers suggests potential barriers to conversion that could be addressed to improve sales.
