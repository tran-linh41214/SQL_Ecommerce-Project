# Explore E-Commerce Dataset with Google Analytics

# üìä Project Title: [SQL_E-commerce Data]  
Author: [Linh Tran]    
Tools Used: SQL  

## Introduction
Welcome to my first project on e-commerce data exploration! This repository contains the SQL script **"SQL_E-commerce Data"**, which analyzes e-commerce data using Google Analytics samples. The objective is to uncover valuable insights into customer behavior, website performance, and transactional trends.

## üìÇFile Description
The script "SQL_E-commerce Data" comprises a series of SQL queries targeted at various aspects of e-commerce data analysis:
- **Monthly Trends Analysis:** Queries to scrutinize visits, pageviews, and transactions, segmented by month.
- **Traffic Source Analysis:** In-depth examination of various traffic sources, assessing total visits, bounce rates, and their overall impact on website engagement.
- **Revenue Analysis by Time and Source:** Advanced queries to analyze product revenue based on different time frames (monthly, weekly) and traffic sources. This helps in understanding which sources and time periods are most lucrative for the e-commerce business.

### Total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb AND March 2017

```sql
--Query 01: calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb AND March 2017 (order by month)
SELECT
    FORMAT_DATE("%Y%m",PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d',date)) AS month,
    SUM(totals.visits) AS visits,
    SUM(totals.pageviews) AS pageviews,
    SUM(totals.transactions) AS transactions,
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
WHERE _table_suffix BETWEEN '0101' AND '0331'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```
